# NBA salaries & science
## Or how much money do we want to spend for entertainment?

I love basketball and as every other basketball fan I enjoy watching NBA games. The best players of the world play against each other, offering a great spectacle. The stadiums are full, the lights are bright and the players are superstars!

I use web scraping to collect NBA salaries and costs of scientific projects. I then compare them using simple vsualizations: a swarmplot, a treeplot and a barplot

How much money are we willing to spend on entertainment?
